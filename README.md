# DreamingBear

Together with a fellow student, I made Dreaming Bear. 
A Unity game about a little girl who lost her teddy bear and is now searching for him in her house. 
With just two weeks of time, we created a lovely and simple game. Below is a sped-up playthrough of the game.

Sadly the current code is not the finished project as that has been lost and I'm trying to retrive it.
The newer version only has a bit more polish and extra cinematics which can be seen here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rovervos_together-with-a-fellow-student-i-made-dreaming-activity-6827560477250465792-R7tr?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web
