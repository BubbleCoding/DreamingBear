# DreamingBear

Together with a fellow student, I made Dreaming Bear. 
A Unity game about a little girl who lost her teddy bear and is now searching for him in her house. 
With just two weeks of time, we created a lovely and simple game. Below is a sped-up playthrough of the game.

Sadly the current code is not the finished project as that has been lost and I'm trying to retrive it.
The newer version only has a bit more polish and extra cinematics which can be seen here: <iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6827558078469300224" height="580" width="504" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" title="Ingevoegde bijdrage"></iframe>
